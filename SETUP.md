## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to load weekend availability"
- Make sure you copied the Apps Script URL correctly in `js/schedule.js`
- Check that your Google Sheet has tabs named exactly "Weekends" and "Config" (case-sensitive)
- Make sure the Apps Script is deployed with "Who has access: Anyone"

### "Invalid password" when trying to book
- Check that the password in the form matches cell B1 in the "Config" tab exactly (case-sensitive)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces in the password

### Weekend doesn't update after booking
- Check your browser's console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Verify the Apps Script has permission to edit the sheet
- Make sure the weekend ID in the "Weekends" tab matches (column A should be 1, 2, 3... not text)

### Website shows old content after updating
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear your browser cache
