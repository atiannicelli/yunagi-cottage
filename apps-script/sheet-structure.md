## Tab 2: "Config"

This tab stores the reservation password.

### Structure

| Column A | Column B |
|----------|----------|
| Password | shoreleave2026 |

**Setup:**
1. Create a new sheet tab named "Config"
2. In cell A1, type: `Password`
3. In cell B1, type: `shoreleave2026` (or whatever password you want to use)

**Security Note:** Anyone with edit access to this Google Sheet can see the password. Only share edit access with trusted people. Guests booking weekends don't need access to the sheet — they only interact with the website.

---

## Setting Up the Sheet

1. **Create a new Google Sheet** in your Google Drive
2. Name it something like "Yūnagi Cottage Bookings"
3. **Rename Sheet1** to "Weekends"
4. Add the column headers (row 1)
5. Copy/paste the weekend data (rows 2-23)
6. Format columns B and C as dates
7. **Create a new tab** and name it "Config"
8. Add the password configuration (A1: "Password", B1: "shoreleave2026")
9. **Open Apps Script** from Extensions > Apps Script
10. Continue with the Apps Script setup in SETUP.md

## Viewing Bookings

When someone makes a reservation:
- Column E will change from "Available" to "Taken"
- Column F will show the guest's name
- Column G will show their email
- Column H will show number of guests
- Column I will show when they booked

You can review this data anytime by opening your Google Sheet. The website only shows "Available" or "Reserved" — guest names are kept private.

---

## Changing the Password

To change the reservation password:
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to the "Config" tab
3. Change the value in cell B1
4. Save (no other changes needed — Apps Script reads this value)

Make sure to tell your guests the new password!
